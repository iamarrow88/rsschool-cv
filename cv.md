## About Myself
Hello, I’m Nana. I like to be a part of RS school community.
I have learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a year,
and I’m feeling interested and excited.
This is time of my life when I am dreaming of having more hours
in the day because there are so many things to do.
I can spend all day long to make up a website
or doing exercises on codrwars. It's make me happy resolving tasks and
searching answers for my questions on the internet :)
But usually I stop myself and divide my time between my job,
my family and my education. As you see I also like drawing,
seat in a chair and to do click-clack on the computer xD
So I climb this mountain slowly as a snail but insistently as a woodpecker
:P

```

  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    return 'Even';
