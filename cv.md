## About Myself
Hello, I’m Nana. I like to be a part of RS school community.
I have learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a year,
and I’m feeling interested and excited.
I can spend all day long to make up a website
or doing exercises on codrwars.
But usually I stop myself and divide my time between my job,
my family and my education.
I hope that this opportunity will change my life, so I’m doing my best.

## Code examples
My solution of KATA from CODEWARS: Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.
```
function even_or_odd(number) {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    return 'Even';
  } else {
    return 'Odd';
  }
}
```
